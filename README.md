# Google-Foobar-Challenge
I got google's foobar invitation after I searchered Python's lambda function via Google Chrome. Well, why not take some coding challenges? 
Once I clicked on'I want to play', it led me to the challenge hosted in Unix environment. 

We can use some simple commands to access the challenges, for example, 'help' to learn the commands needed, for example 'ls' to list all the documents in the folder, 'cd' to change to the subfolder where we can access the challenge and 'edit' python/java file.

It encompasses five levels of challenges frome easy (level 1 & 2) to medium (level 3), and eventually hard (level 4 & 5), with 1 assignement for level 1, two for level 2 and two for level 3.
Once accomplish level 2, it provides a link to share with my friends with the chance of begining their own Foobar Challenge. 
After pass level 3 challenges, it will ask if we want to share my solutions with a Google Recruiter.
